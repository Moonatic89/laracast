        "desc" => "React Native is a mobile app development framework that allows you to build and deploy native mobile apps to both iOS and Android devices. As web developers, leveraging the existing popularity of React can benefit many people who have no experience building mobile apps. Developers only have to maintain one codebase and can quickly get started using existing JavaScript and CSS knowledge. Expo is a framework on top of React Native, which provides even more tools and services that make your development experience similar to the experience of creating web applications.
                   In this series, we’ll learn how to use tools within the React Native ecosystem to build robust and maintainable mobile apps. We’ll create a simple clone of the Twitter mobile app, along with a Laravel API backend that powers it.",

        "desc" => "Inertia.js, created by Jonathan Reinink, is an incredible tool that glues a server-side framework, like Laravel, to a client-side framework, like Vue. Think of it as a new way to build traditional server-driven applications. With Inertia, you can continue using server-side routing, and controllers, and authentication, and validation. With Inertia, you don't need to learn how to build an API, and you definitely don't need to use OAuth. Instead, relax and continue creating apps the way you traditionally would.
                   I really think you're going to enjoy Inertia as much as I do. In fact, Laracasts itself uses Inertia under the hood; I wouldn't have it any other way. So let me show you everything I know about building modern apps with Laravel, Vue, and Inertia.js in this series.",
