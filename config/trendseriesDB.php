With that in mind, in this series, we'll use the common desire for a blog - with categories, tags, comments, email notifications, and more - as our goal. Laravel will be the tool that helps us get there. Each lesson, geared toward newcomers to Laravel, will provide instructions and techniques that will get you to the finish line.
                   This version of our popular Laravel From Scratch series was recorded in 2021, and uses Laravel 8.",

Think of it as a new way to build traditional server-driven applications. With Inertia, you can continue using server-side routing, and controllers, and authentication, and validation. With Inertia, you don't need to learn how to build an API, and you definitely don't need to use OAuth. Instead, relax and continue creating apps the way you traditionally would.
                   I really think you're going to enjoy Inertia as much as I do. In fact, Laracasts itself uses Inertia under the hood; I wouldn't have it any other way. So let me show you everything I know about building modern apps with Laravel, Vue, and Inertia.js in this series.",
